Keys to success:
Keep It Simple — Try not to let aesthetics get in the way of ease of use. Keep your wedding website simple so that it’s clear to guests where to find directions, the RSVP, gift registry and more.

Be Informative - Think about common questions guests will have: Do you accept cash gifts? Are children welcome? Is there parking? Is the venue accessible?

Celebrate the Moment — Photography of the couple should be front and center. That’s who guests are here to celebrate!
